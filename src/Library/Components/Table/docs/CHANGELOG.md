## [2.0.2] - 2024-05-18

### 🔧 Bugfix — Duplicate JOIN Guard & Filter Stability

### Fixed
- Prevented duplicate JOINs causing "Not unique table/alias" by applying guarded join assembly in relationship setup.
- Legacy filters continue to qualify columns and use proper operators (LIKE/IN).

### Technical Details
```php
// Datatables.php — setupRelationships (foreign key path)
$joins = [];
foreach ($foreignKeys as $foreignKey => $localKey) {
    $tables = explode('.', $foreignKey);
    $foreignTable = $tables[0];
    $joins[] = ['type' => 'left', 'table' => $foreignTable, 'first' => $foreignKey, 'second' => $localKey];
}
$this->applyRelationJoins($modelData, $joins); // skips duplicates safely
```

### Documentation
- Updated INDEX.md (version notes) and development summaries.

---

## [2.0.1] - 2024-04-28

### 🔧 Bugfix & Hardening — Action List Merge and Search UI Guard

### Fixed
- Resolved "Only variables should be passed by reference" warning in action list determination by assigning function results to variables before passing into `array_merge_recursive_distinct`.
- Guarded Search UI script builder to prevent negative/undefined index usage in chained select logic.

### Changed
- Safer logic in `Search::script_next_data` for computing `$lastTarget` to avoid out-of-range offsets.

### Documentation
- Updated development summary with a detailed session log, outcomes, and next roadmap steps.
- Added this changelog entry to track the patch.

### Technical Details
```php
// Datatables.php
private function determineActionList($actions)
{
    if ($actions === true) {
        return $this->getDefaultActions();
    }

    if (is_array($actions)) {
        // Fix: pass-by-reference requires variables, not function call results
        $defaults  = $this->getDefaultActions();
        $overrides = $actions;
        return array_merge_recursive_distinct($defaults, $overrides);
    }

    return [];
}
```

```php
// Search.php (snippet)
$firstTarget = $fieldsets[0];
$__lastIndex = count($fieldsets) - 2;
    $lastTarget  = ($__lastIndex >= 0 && isset($fieldsets[$__lastIndex])) ? $fieldsets[$__lastIndex] : null;
```

- **📊 Schema Detection**: Robust schema analysis for various table types and connection configurations
- **🎯 Column Selection**: Intelligent column selection avoiding system/hidden columns

### Technical Implementation
```php
// Before v2.0.0 - Manual configuration required
'view_report_summary' => [
    'class' => 'App\\Models\\ReportSummary',
    'primary_key' => null,
    'default_order' => ['period', 'desc'],
    'default_columns' => ['period', 'name', 'value'],
    // ... 20+ lines of configuration
],

// After v2.0.0 - Zero configuration needed!
class ReportSummary extends Model {
    protected $connection = 'mysql_mantra_etl';
    protected $table = 'view_report_summary';
    // Auto-discovery handles everything else automatically!
}
```

**Fatal Error Resolution**

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Resolved duplicate `setupRelationships()` method causing "Cannot redeclare" fatal errors
- **Architecture Issue**: Implemented dynamic relationship detection system
- **System Stability**: Fixed table loading crashes and method conflicts
- **User Model**: Enhanced `getUserInfo()` method with complete field selection

### Still In Progress
- **❌ PENDING**: User table relationship data (group_name, group_alias, group_info still showing NULL)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Dynamic relationship integration may not be properly connected to DataTables processing

### Enhanced
- **User Model**: Enhanced `getUserInfo()` method with complete relationship data retrieval
- **Dynamic Relationship System**: Implemented intelligent relationship detection and processing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Created foundation for universal data source support

### Added

- **Intelligent Fallback**: General foreign key handling for tables without specific relationship methods
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive debugging information for relationship processing
- **Complete Documentation**: Detailed development summary and next enhancement plans

### Changed
- **Relationship Processing**: Moved from static hard-coded approach to dynamic model-based system
- **Method Architecture**: Single `setupRelationships()` method handling both specific and general cases
- **Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and debugging capabilities

### Technical Details
```php
// Enhanced User Model - getUserInfo() method
->select('users.*', 'base_user_group.group_id', 
        'base_group.group_name', 'base_group.group_alias', 'base_group.group_info')

// Dynamic Relationship Detection  
if ($tableName === 'users' && method_exists($modelClass, 'getUserInfo')) {
    $userModel = new $modelClass;
    return $userModel->getUserInfo(false, false);
}
```

### Testing Results
- ❌ **Before Fix**: group_name, group_alias, group_info all showing NULL + Fatal errors
- ⚠️ **Current Status**: 
  - ✅ Fatal errors resolved (no more crashes)
  - ✅ User table data loading correctly
  - ❌ Relationship data still showing NULL (group_name, group_alias, group_info)
- ✅ **Performance**: No regression in query performance
- ✅ **Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible with existing implementations

### Next Steps Required

$this->table->setMethod('POST'); // Caused filtering to fail

// After (FIXED)  
// $this->table->setMethod('POST'); // Disabled - using GET for filtering compatibility
```

### Files Modified
- `vendor/incodiy/codiy/src/Controllers/Admin/System/UserController.php`
- `public/assets/templates/default/js/datatables/filter.js` (debug cleanup)
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/` folder
